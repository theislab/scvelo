**scVelo** is a scalable toolkit for RNA velocity analysis in single cells, based on
`Bergen et al. (Nature Biotech, 2020) <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0591-3>`_.

RNA velocity enables the recovery of directed dynamic information by leveraging splicing kinetics.
scVelo generalizes the concept of RNA velocity
(`La Manno et al., Nature, 2018 <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0414-6>`_)
by relaxing previously made assumptions with a stochastic and a dynamical model that solves the full
transcriptional dynamics. It thereby adapts RNA velocity to widely varying specifications such as non-stationary populations.

scVelo is compatible with scanpy_ and hosts efficient implementations of all RNA velocity models.

scVelo's key applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- estimate RNA velocity to study cellular dynamics.
- identify putative driver genes and regimes of regulatory changes.
- infer a latent time to reconstruct the temporal sequence of transcriptomic events.
- estimate reaction rates of transcription, splicing and degradation.
- use statistical tests, e.g., to detect different kinetics regimes.

scVelo has, for instance, recently been used to study immune response in COVID-19
patients and dynamic processes in human lung regeneration. Find out more in this list of
